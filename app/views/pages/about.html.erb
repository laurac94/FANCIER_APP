<h2>hi welcome to fancier!</h2>
<p>Fancier is a global community of creative people who like to shine and express themselves. We are the first online marketplace specialized in vintage festival outfits, custom-made disguises, and original cosplay styles.</p>
<p>From Burning Man to Coachella, Tomorrow Land or your very own Halloween Party - we've got you covered. We believe that looking fancy doesn't have to involve big budgets or shopping fast fashion.</p>
<p>The fashion industry is one of the biggest threads to the global climate. Reducing, reducing and recycling by buying vintage is a solid way to make a positive impact.</p>
